<h1>FizzBuzz Algorithm</h1>
<br>
Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and  respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible by 3, it is substituted with fizz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "fizz buzz." In essence, it emulates the famous children game "fizz buzz".
